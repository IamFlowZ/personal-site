I'm currently working on becoming a [certified Neo4j Developer](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/neo4j-certification/) through [Neo4j's Graph Academy](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/). 
Neo4j is so easy to get started with, that I've been able to make working products without any additional training.
However learning the technology from it's creators has provided me with more depth than what I could have achieved solely on my own.
